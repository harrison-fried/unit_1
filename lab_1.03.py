Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens?           it says dogs are really cool
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead?   istead of going animal = dogs, id say, animal = cats

2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce?  it gives an error
    2. Why does this happen?           i did not give 'dogs' a value
